 * This structure represents controller button latch data.

 * With each sampling cycle, the controller service compares the new pressed & released button states
 * with the previously collected pressed button states. This comparison will result in the following possible
 * states for each button:
 *
 *  - `make`: The button has just been pressed with its prior state being the released state. Transition from
 *      'released' state to 'pressed' state.
 *
 *  - `press`: The button is currently in the 'pressed' state.
 *
 *  - `break`: The button has just been released with its prior state being the 'pressed' state. Transition from 'pressed' state to 'release' state.
 *
 *  - `release`: The button is currently in the 'released' state.
 *
 * It is possible for a button to (briefly) be in two states at the same time. Valid combinations are as follows:
 *
 *  - `make` & `press`
 *
 *  - `break` & `release`
 *
 * In other words, if a button is in the `make` state, then it is also in the `press` state. However, this is not the case
 * for the inverse. A button in the `press` state does not need to be in the `make` state.
 *
 * These comparison results are stored internally as latch data and can be retrieved using the APIs ::sceCtrlPeekLatch() and
 * ::sceCtrlReadLatch(). ::PspCtrlButtons can be used to find out the state of each button.
 *
 * @remark The same can be accomplished by using the different sceCtrl[Read/Peek]Buffer[Positive/Negative]() APIs
