# Adrenaline Save State
---

Adrenaline has native support to Save States, accessible in the [Adrenaline Menu](../04-AdrenalineMenu.md). It supports creations of up to 31 save states.

## What is a Save State

A save state is a snapshot of the current status of a game, allowing you to save and restore your progress at any point. Unlike traditional in-game saves, save states capture everything in memory, so you can resume exactly where you left off, even if the game itself doesnâ€™t support saving at that moment.

## Creating Save State

To create a save state, do the following:

1. Open **Adrenaline Menu**
	1. Hold `HOME` button to open PSVita/PSTV's **Quick Menu**

3. Select an empty state slot
